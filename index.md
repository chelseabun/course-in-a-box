## Mastering technology for everyday living.

This course is designed to help you (and your peers) increase confidence in using technology and the internet, by learning alongside each other. The course has an Australian focus and is especially designed for those who have recently become regular users of computers or mobile devices, but still feel as though they have much to learn. It has an emphasis on group learning, i.e. it is designed for groups who meet face-to-face and learn from each others questions and experiences. However, it is still valuable for individual learners.
