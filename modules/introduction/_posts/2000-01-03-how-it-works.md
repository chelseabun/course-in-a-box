# How It Works

Each session is divided into a rough schedule. 

1. Homework (10-15 minutes before each session)

This is a small activity that is set in the previous session, for you to complete at home before the next one. It gives each learner a chance to think about the topic and bring questions or comments to the next session. Remember that your contributtion to the group is key.

2. Hello and grab-a-cuppa (5 minutes)

Arrive at your session, grab a drink and get settled. 

3. Park your questions.
