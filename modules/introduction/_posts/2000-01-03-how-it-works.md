# How It Works

Each session is designed to follow a rough schedule. Most of the tasks or discussions are specifically for encouraging group work. 

1. Homework (10-15 minutes before each session)

This is a small activity that is set in the previous session, for you to complete at home before the next one. It gives each learner a chance to think about the topic and bring questions or comments to the next session. Remember that your contributtion to the group is key.

2. Hello and grab-a-cuppa (5 minutes)

Arrive at your session, grab a cuppa and get settled. The facilitator might set up a powerpoint so the group can easily see the content together. 

3. Post your questions. (10 minutes)

This is a really handy step. We all have specific questions about our internet or device so go around the room and relay your question to the group. The facilitator can write these up on butchers paper or a whiteboard. By having them up on display its easier for the group to answer them or help discover the answer at anytime during the session. 

4. Course module (15-20  minutes)


5. Answers and more questions (15-20 minutes)


6. Prep for next session and wrap up.
