# Group Learning

We often learn more about technology and the internet by sharing experiences with others in a similar situation. That's why this course is best suited to small groups of people who are open to sharing their knowledge and experiences over several face-to-face sessions (about an hour each). 

Ideally, there will be one person in the group to facilitate the sessions (sort of like an MC). A facilitator doesn't have to know the subject, they just have to be comfortable getting the ball rolling each session. 

So, the first step is to introduce or nominate the group's facilitator. Then on the next page, go through the rough schedule of each session.
