# Group Learning

Interaction is key to this learning experience. We often learn more about technology and the internet by sharing experiences with others in a similar situation. That's why this course is best suited to small groups of people who are open to sharing their knowledge and experiences over several face-to-face sessions (about an hour each). 

Ideally, there will be one person in the group to facilitate the sessions (sort of like an MC). A facilitator doesn't have to know the subject, they just have to be comfortable getting the ball rolling each session. 

# Group Chat (5-10 minutes)

Think of something new you used recently on the internet or your mobile device. Go around the table and share a bit about that experience: How did you find out about it? Who (if anyone) helped you?

OR

Share a useful website or other resource (if you have one) that you have used to help find out more about your using your device.
