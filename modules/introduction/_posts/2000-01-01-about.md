# Welcome

This short course is designed to help you find and use information to make decisions around your internet connections. You probably already have an internet connection of some type, however, the ways you use the internet and how much you use it can change overtime. Having a more thorough understanding of internet connections can help you make better decisions.

With this in mind, as well as the current rollout of the National Broadband Network, many Australians will review their internet plans and make more decisions about how best to connect to the internet. With so much information out there, sometimes it is difficult to find what you need and understand what exactly some of it means for your own circumstances.

 By the end of the course, hopefully you will have

 - Had the opportunity to meet others and learn from their experiences
 - An understanding of several different ways you can connect your device (laptop, tv, mobile) to the internet
 - More knowledge of how to use the internet when you are not at home
 - Choose plans and find devices that meet your specific needs
