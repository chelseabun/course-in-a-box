# Welcome

This short course is designed to help you and your peers make decisions around your internet connections. You probably already have an internet connection of some type, however, the ways you use the internet and how much you use it can change overtime. Having a better understanding of internet connections can help you make better decisions.

As the National Broadband Network continues to roll out, many Australians will review their internet plans and make new decisions about how best to connect to the internet. With so much information out there, sometimes it is difficult to find what you need and understand what exactly some of it means for your own circumstances.

The course aims are: 

 - Increase your confidence to make decisions about your internet connections and your devices
 - Meet others with similar questions and learn from their experiences
 - Have a basic understanding of several different ways you can connect your device (laptop, tv, mobile) to the internet
 - Choose plans and find devices that meet your specific needs
